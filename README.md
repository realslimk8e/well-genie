## 📖 Project Vision
WellGenie empowers individuals to better understand and manage their personal health by providing an intelligent desktop application.  
The system integrates diverse health data sources and delivers personalized, conversational insights through a chatbot interface.  

Our goal is to create a trusted digital health companion that helps users make informed decisions about their habits, lifestyle, and overall well-being.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Modern individuals generate vast amounts of health-related data through wearables, medical reports, diet trackers, fitness apps, and daily habits. However, this data often remains:  
- Scattered and siloed across multiple platforms  
- Difficult to interpret without technical or medical expertise  
- Lacking personalized insights and accessibility  

As a result:  
- Users cannot easily consolidate their health information into a unified view.  
- Medical insights and habit-based recommendations are not readily available without professional consultation.  
- Existing solutions are often too technical, fragmented, or impersonal.  

This gap leaves users without actionable insights, limiting their ability to proactively manage their health.
